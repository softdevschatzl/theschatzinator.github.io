          <p class = "aboutpara">Hello! Welcome to my web page I built from scratch using HTML, CSS and a 
            tasteful amount of JavaScript. I am a student of Computer Science from Massacusetts, I am hardworking, 
            enthusiastic and a quick-learner. I have always been fascinated by computing, getting my start 
            playing games, and later writing my own mods for games using C#. It wasn't until later when 
            I started getting into web and application development that I was enthralled by seeing my work 
            come to life and seeing people use it.
          </p>
          <p class = "aboutpara">Aside from the professional setting, I am an avid guitarist, playing mostly
            rock, blues, funk and some R&B. I enjoy snowboarding, playing video games, reading,
            and learning about woodworking.
