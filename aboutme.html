          <p class = "aboutpara">Hi! My name is John and I am a web and application developer from Massachusetts. 
            I got my start in development by creating mods for my favorite video games, mostly in C#, 
            but recently working on front-end projects made me fall in love with seeing my work come to life
            and especially in web development, seeing the freedom I had with how I want things to look and function. 
            Through my passion for computing I am enthusiastic and a quick learner, taking every opportunity 
            to learn and not only improve my skills, but improve as a general problem solver and team member.
          </p>
          <p class = "aboutpara">Aside from the professional setting, I am an avid guitarist, playing mostly
            rock, blues, funk and some R&B. I enjoy snowboarding, playing video games, reading,
            fishing and reading documentation.
