          <p class = "aboutpara">Hello! Welcome to my web page I built from scratch using HTML and CSS (No front-end frameworks).
            I am a student of Computer Science from Braintree, Massachusetts who has had a fascination with computing
            since my father introduced me to my first IBM machine. Even as a child I was
            enthralled by the possibilities that were housed within this little metal box.
            Now, as I am pursuing the end of my Bachelor's Degree, I am beginning to put
            together a portfolio/resume of everything I've accomplished within this field.
          </p>
          <p class = "aboutpara">Aside from the professional setting, I am an avid guitarist, playing mostly
            rock, blues, funk and some R&B. I enjoy snowboarding, playing video games, reading,
            and learning about woodworking.
